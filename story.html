  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p>Once upon a time in a small town where dogs outnumbered people (or so it felt), Heath, a legendary dog lover and entrepreneur, decided to create the ultimate shop where every pup could find the perfect toy, collar, or soap.</p>
  <p>Inspired by his own scrappy dog, Squidgy, who chewed through every toy in sight, Heath crafted durable, fun, and stylish products with one mission: <em>make dogs happy, and their humans even happier.</em></p>
  <p>After countless late nights coding, testing chew toys, and smelling dozens of shampoo scents, Heath‚Äôs Doggo Shop was born ‚Äî a place where quality meets heart.</p>
  <p>Today, we‚Äôre proud to serve thousands of happy doggos and their humans worldwide. From tiny treats to mega toys, every product has a story, a smile, and a wag behind it.</p>
  <p>Thanks for stopping by ‚Äî let‚Äôs keep the tails wagging!</p>
